    This schematron corresponds to the CQL-base HQMF IG Release 1, STU 3, August 2018.
     
	  This schematron implements conformance for QDM Templates for CQL-Based HQMF data files. 
	  It contains conformance tests adherent to both Volume 1 and Volume 3 implementation guides (IG).
	  
	
	  In this schematron conformance rules and assertions for Volume 1 are prefixed with "vol-I" in their identifiers.
	  The numbers following "vol-I" reference "Conformance Requirement" identifiers in the Volume I implementation guide.

	  Conformance rules and assertions NOT prefixed with "vol-I" correspond to conformance statements in the Volume 3 
	  QDM Templates for CQL-based HQMF IG V3 implementation guide.
	  
	  Updates as of 08-23-2018
	       - Removed extension from context on all rules examining templateId conformance in all entry templates
	       - Fixed statusCode = 'active' conformance in Assessment Order and Procedure Recommended V2
	       - Removed author participation conformance check in Device Applied, Laboratory Test Performed, Medication Administered, 
	                 Medication Discharge and Substance Administered
	       - Added setId conformance on expressionDocument in HQMF document header
	       - Fixed role classCode = 'ADMM' in Substance Recommended
	       - Fixed playingMaterial classCode = 'MAT' in Substance Recommended
	       - Changed typeCode='DRV' to typeCode='PRF' conformance in ParticipationType of Provider Characteristic
	       - Added role constraints to optional performer participation in Medication Dispensed V2
	       - Added new template "Days Supplied"
